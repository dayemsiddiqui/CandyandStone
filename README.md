This is an opensource OOP project founded by the students of IBA under the supervision by Abdul Wajed Khan


First Read the official question on LMS, before proceeding.

===========================================
===========================================

Our End Product should be:
1. Totally complete in light of the questions asked and requirments set.

2. Professional.


===========================================
Things that should be kept in mind:

1. Sir asked for acknowledgements. There must be reason. We should make a note of every stackoverflow question, or every website we stumble upon, and keep a list of links while we are working.

2. Sir mentioned "areas for optimization by removing repeated operations using loops and lookup tables".
So there has to be a place(s) in the code, where this is applicable, and we should look it up.

3. Sir mentioned "Suggest variations to the gameplay... ". This means that current gameplay should not be changed, and be used as it is.

===========================================

Proposal as to how we should approach:

1. Read Code, and see where we can modify, list the parts down, with the possible modifications.

2. Improve on the bare basic code. And make NO additional amendments, rather we can aim to cut down unwanted features (current scoring). satisfying Q1, Q2

3. Find better artworks. Simple icons of similar theme. We create a interface for choosing the theme.
satisfying Q3

4. Work on Pause, Resume. Saving and Loading. Music.

5. Implement high score and leadboard functioanlity.

6. Refine Our work

7. Make acknowledgements official and in a pdf or something.

8. Make a document regarding suggested improvements.
